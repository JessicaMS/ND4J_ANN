Simple Neural Network written from scratch using ND4J.

Over time, has grown to make use of more ND4J and DL4J features and Alex Black's PlotUtil (helper functions for JFree graph).

- Builds project dependencies using Maven (POM.XML)
- Reads CSV files with Canova
- Iterates through DataSets by a batch size using DL4J objects
- Evaluates neural network using DL4J's Evaluation object
- Plot's results using JFree and PlotUtil.java
